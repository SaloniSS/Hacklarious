          MoneyMoneyMoney is a chrome extension that displays the value of the
          products you view in terms of things you actually understand! Choices
          include number of chipotle burritos, number of boba trips, number of
          chicken nuggets, or of course, the most valuable asset of our age,
          rolls of toilet paper.

          How does it work? When you go on amazon to make another one of your
          mindless purchases, MoneyMoneyMoney will remind you just how many
          other things you could buy with that cash.
